Simple Sitemap Creator requires the Lazarus IDE (v1.5 atleast) & FreePascal compiler to build.

Windows
-------
The easiest options is to download the latest installer from http://www.lazarus-ide.org/

FreeBSD/Linux/OSX
-----------------
There are a few options for UNIX based OS, this is my preferred method:

Download and install FreePascal from http://www.freepascal.org/
(FreeBSD/Linux users can install from pkg/ports/yum/apt/etc)

Checkout the Lazarus source from their subversion repo:
(Again FreeBSD/Linux users should find a version of Lazarus in their package manager)

svn co http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/lazarus/trunk lazarus

Then build the IDE

cd lazarus
make bigide
[FreeBSD] gmake bigide

After installation, simply load the IDE, open simplesitemapcreator.lpi from Project menu ->
Open Project
Shift-F9 to build the program
